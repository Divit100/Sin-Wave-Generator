# Sin-Wave-Generator

In this project,using the LSTM(long short term memory) layer in  a dense neural network ,I was able to predict the sine values given some other sin values as training data.
Once the model was ready,I was able to predict brand new sin values.The predicted wave is in the orange colour below:
